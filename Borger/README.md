# Borger Service

## Running Locally

First create and change python env to `borger-env`.

```sh
python3 -m venv borger-env
```

If `borger-env` already exists.

```sh
source borger-env/bin/activate
```

> If you use fish then you need to use fish extension
> `source borger-env/bin/activate.fish`

Then install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
